                <h2>Interest in App Inventor</h2>
                <p>One of the main reasons why I’m interested in working with App Inventor is that I truly love the idea of accessible Android development
                     for everyone and would like to contribute to the project to make it even better. Moreover, this project covers my main areas of interest
                     (Software Engineering, Java & Android development).</p>

            <div id="project" class="section">
                <h2>Proposed Summer Project</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>My main interest in working for the App Inventor project revolves around the Component Projects.
                    Due to the varying length of the projects, I would like to make up a full 3 month workload.
                    Therefore, my projects of interest are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visualisation Component - Main project that I'm interested in</li>
                        <li>Menu Options</li>
                        <li>Improvements in ListView</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>I am well aware that the projects that I would be working on would potentially change, regardless, I would like to provide a short summary on
                    how I would approach each project.</p>

                <h3>Visualisation Component</h3>
                <p>For this project, I propose to use the MPAndroidChart library, since it is well documented, provides a variety of useful features and extensive customization,
                    a lot of different chart types and easy adaptability to projects. In fact, I have used this library in one of my previous projects (see <a href="#team-finbuddy">FinBuddy</a>)
                    and would very much lean towards using it again. In general, my plan for the project would be:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Install the MPAndroidChart dependency to the build</li>
                    <li>Create an abstract class ChartComponent which extends from AndroidViewComponent for charts
                        (since charts share a lot of common attributes, events and methods). Since all of the charts have their
                        own counterparts (such as LineDataSet for the DataSet of the LineChart), I will most likely go with making the
                        ChartComponent abstract class a generic class, so we can pass in the class type per chart.</li>
                    <li>Establish and make a UML diagram of the chart attributes. This way, I will be able to see the common functionality
                        between charts, so that it can all be added to the abstract class. For instance, each chart has a Legend, DataSet,
                        XAxis, YAxis, Colors, ValueFormatter, AxisValueFormatter and various style settings. Therefore methods
                        setting and getting these values can be added in the ChartComponent class.
                    </li>
                    <li>Following up on the UML diagram, concrete charts have their own specific functionality. For instance, PieChart
                        has an attribute whether to show the slice labels in percentage or as values. As such, these will be included
                        in the UML diagram.
                    </li>
                    <li>Moving on to the implementation, after the UML diagram is fully established, I can then proceed to
                        implementing the actual attributes and relevant methods with annotations for each chart, starting
                        with ChartComponent.
                    </li>
                    <li>After ChartComponent is done, I will then proceed with concrete chart implementations. I plan
                        to implement every chart that is available in the MPAndroidChart library, and for each chart,
                        I will make a seperate class that extends the abstract ChartComponent class. The components
                        will then be put under a new category "Charts". In the end, the following classes for
                        concrete implementations will be present: LineChart, BarChart, PieChart, ScatterChart,
                        BubbleChart, RadarChart, CandleStickChart.
                    </li>
                    <li>After we are done with the attributes, events are needed for added functionality to the
                        charts. Fortunately, MPAndroidChart provides various Gestures and an OnGestureListener which
                        works via callbacks and MotionEvents. The gestures include the typical Android view events (long-press,
                        tap, double-tap, touch up, touch down) plus a few extra ones related to the charts (zoom, drag).
                        I plan to implement all of these. In general, these apply to every chart and will go to
                        ChartComponent.
                    </li>
                    <li>Write tests for the chart component as functionality is gradually added</li>
                    <li>Create an abstract class MockChartComponent that extends from MockVisibleComponent (so
                        that we may see our visual changes in the editor itself)
                    </li>
                    <li>For each concrete chart class, create a class for the Mock Component that extends from MockChartComponent.</li>
                    <li>Write the corresponding documentation for each Chart component, possibly under a new page of category Charts.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Menu Options</h3>
                <p>General summary of the plan for the adding Menu Options project:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create new component MenuOptions that extends the AndroidNonvisibleComponent class. This could then be put under
                        the UserInterface category.
                    </li>
                    <li>Create getters and setters for the property "Menu Elements" which would represent all 
                        user defined Menu Elements. I believe it would be a good idea to keep the current
                        default menu options remain there, but perhaps keep them at the end of the list.
                    </li>
                    <li>Write additional code in the component itself to handle adding the Menu Elements into the
                        context menu and attaching listeners to them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make all menu options use the same listener, but make the event return a certain value
                        (either Menu entry name or index) through dispatchEvent.
                    </li>
                    <li>Write an event for the listener, which would have one attribute - the value returned by the callback
                        (Menu entry name/index)</li>
                    <li>
                        Additional alterations to Form.java might be needed, since two menu options are added in that class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Write tests for the component.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Write documentation for the component.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Improvements in ListView</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify all required extensions and improvements to list view to get the general idea of the features to implement</li>
                    <li>Create a custom adapter for the list view that can be extended with the needed features (such as adding icons and pictures)</li>
                    <li>Right now I would consider perhaps having one list for images and one for text, so that the adapter would
                        have both an Image and a String. In the case where one of them is not present, it is simply not displayed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add additional properties for the new features (e.g. Pictures list attribute for icons/pictures)</li>
                    <li>Write tests for the new features</li>
                    <li>Write documentation for the new features</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Experience With Development Tools</h2>
                <h3>Android SDK</h3>
                <p>I have gained an extensive understanding of the Android SDK throughout developing Android applications for personal projects.
                    I have one major Android application release on the Google Play appstore
                    (see <a href="#team-finbuddy">Experience With Teams</a> for link and teamwork details), which is a finance manager application.
                    Specifically, the application involved the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extending base Android view functionality, such as implementing a custom spinner with icons to adapt to the needs of the application</li>
                    <li>Implementing a custom side navigation menu, which has options that perform the required functionality</li>
                    <li>Extending the functionality of the standard action bar by adding additional buttons and dynamically changing the title</li>
                    <li>Making use of a 3rd party Calendar library (Caldroid) to build the main interface of the calendar to the project's needs.
                        This also involved writing additional code to extend the Calendar to the personal needs of the project.
                        The extra functionality, for instace, is displaying the amount of money spent/earned in one day on the Calendar.
                    </li>
                    <li>Implementing charts to display statistics about the user's expenses and savings. This has been done using the MPAndroidChart library.</li>
                    <li>Implementing other 3rd party libraries to achieve various functionality, such as advertisements and an image gallery.</li>
                    <li>Creation and utilizing of a SQLite database to store the user's data and being able to access it efficiently</li>
                    <li>Writing the logic for the application itself (events, goals, tasks, recurring events, total expense/income calculation, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Input validation of the text input fields (involved regexp, such as disallowing to input "." as a numeric value, or allowing to
                        input at most 2 numbers after the decimal point)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Alongside this, I have also made an Android application for a high school project (see <a href="#team-highschool">Experience With Team</a> link for more information
                and the report that we made)</p>

                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>Alongside Android Development (see section below), I have quite an extensive comprehension of Java due
                    to the large focus of the language in my University. So far, three courses involved extensive coding
                    in Java - Object Oriented Programming, Algorithms & Data Structures, OOP Project. In the first two courses, I was
                    mainly writing small programs that involved solving a specific task, such as finding the shortest path
                    to a location using Dijkstra's algorithm, or writing an entire program that allows building a catalog (e.g. of cars)
                    dynamically by user input and then storing the data locally. The OOP Project involved:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Various logic code to filter smaller subsets of data from collections in accordance to user preferences.</li>
                    <li>Writing custom extensions of Java classes (such as custom comparables for sorting)</li>
                    <li>Serverside code to connect to a MongoDB database.</li>
                    <li>Database queries in Java with the help of the Spring Boot library. An example of a query I've written is one that
                        uses regex to retrieve usernames matching a certain pattern.</li>
                    <li>Utilizing the DAO design pattern for data access within the server code.</li>
                    <li>Making the database accessible via a REST controller.</li>
                    <li>Encrypted password storage in the database.</li>
                    <li>pom.xml maintenance, deploying server to remote location (Heroku), setting up GitLab CI to test
                        for compilation, CheckStyle and test coverage.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>Learned JavaScript in univesity as part of the  Web & Database Technology course. I have built a Chess web application powered by
                    Node.js (on the server) and JavaScript (on the client) in collaboration with another student. The project itself involved
                    writing the entire Chess logic from scratch both on the client and the server.
                    We have fully implemented the majority of chess rules, including movement, invalid move checking,
                    checkmating, converting Pawn after it reaches the other side of the board and movement of the board. Visually, we have written the entire html
                    from scratch and styled it with CSS, while also providing various functionality with clientside JavaScript (e.g. blinking tile in red when invalid move
                    is made). We kept some logic on the serverside, such as pairing players for matches, returning responses for certain actions (such as end of match,
                    move validity, etc.). I have also written small amounts of JavaScript code to perform small tasks (e.g. highlight anchor links in
                    this proposal page, initialize & load navigation bar in my personal website)</p>

                <p>I have worked together with 3 other people during the last year of my high school on an Android application. Although my
                    collaborators did not code (I was responsible for all the programming work), they have participated in suggesting ideas,
                    designing the application, suggesting various new features, changes and modifications of the code. Therefore, communication was
                    a crucial aspect of this project, and therefore I have been able to successfully satisfy each request and work closely
                    with my teammates, and the end result is a fully functioning Android application.

                <h3 id="team-highschool">Business Simulation Android Application Project for High School</h3>
                <p>I have worked together with 2 fellow students in building an Android application from scratch. We were all beginners
                    to Android and Java development then, and I took the role as the lead programmer. I was able to succesfully
                    carry out requests and communicate on mutual changes with my group mates, and we successfully managed to
                    combine our work together. It was also generally a very good mutual learning experience, as we all
                    became acquainted with Android development, and for me, this was a really good head start into Android development.
                    Moreover, I have successfully been able to teach my teammates how to build Android layouts in XML.
                    There is an extensive documentation and presentation slides for the application, which were intended for a general
                    public with no experience in programming. Unfortunately, it was all written in the Lithuanian language, but I
                    think this gives a good impression of my involvement in Android development at a young age (this was done roughly 2-3 years ago):
