                <h2>Interest in App Inventor</h2>
                <p>One of the main reasons why I’m interested in working with App Inventor is that I truly love the idea of accessible Android development
                     for everyone and would like to contribute to the project to make it even better. Moreover, this project covers my main areas of interest
                     (Software Engineering, Java & Android development).</p>

                <h2>Interest In Introductory Programming</h2>
                <p>Being a freshman, I have not had the opportunity to get involved in teaching as actively yet. However, throughout my first year of university,
                    I have actively helped my fellow peers learn and understand concepts & topics better by explaining it in depth and providing my own examples,
                    as well as helping them with any issues that they have encountered in their code projects, assignments or while self-studying. I have helped with the following courses:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>OOP Project (Java Application)</li>
                        <li>Object-Oriented Programming (in Java)</li>
                        <li>Algorithms & Data Structures (algorithmic problems in Java)</li>
                        <li>Web & Database Technology (JavaScript)</li>
                        <li>Computer Organization (Assembly)</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Experience With Development Tools</h2>
                <h3>Android SDK</h3>
                <p>I have gained an extensive understanding of the Android SDK throughout developing Android applications for personal projects.
                    I have one major Android application release on the Google Play appstore
                    (see <a href="#team">Experience With Teams</a> for link and teamwork details), which is a finance manager application.
                    Specifically, the application involved the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extending base Java view functionality, such as implementing a custom spinner with icons to adapt to the needs of the application</li>
                    <li>Implementing a custom side navigation menu, which has options that perform the required functionality</li>
                    <li>Extending the functionality of the standard action bar by adding additional buttons and dynamically changing the title</li>
                    <li>Making use of a 3rd party Calendar library (Caldroid) to build the main interface of the calendar to the project's needs.
                        This also involved writing additional code to extend the Calendar to the personal needs of the project.
                        The extra functionality, for instace, is displaying the amount of money spent/earned in one day on the Calendar.
                    </li>
                    <li>Implementing charts to display statistics about the user's expenses and savings. This has been done using the MPAndroidChart library.</li>
                    <li>Implementing other 3rd party libraries to achieve various functionality, such as advertisements and an image gallery.</li>
                    <li>Creation and utilizing of a SQLite database to store the user's data and being able to access it efficiently</li>
                    <li>Writing the logic for the application itself (events, goals, tasks, recurring events, total expense/income calculation, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Input validation of the text input fields (involved regexp, such as disallowing to input "." as a numeric value, or allowing to
                        input at most 2 numbers after the decimal point.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>Alongside Android Development (see section below), I have quite an extensive comprehension of Java due
                    to the large focus of the language in my University. So far, three courses involved extensive coding
                    in Java - Object Oriented Programming, Algorithms & Data Structures, OOP Project. In the first two courses, I was
                    mainly writing small programs that involved solving a specific task, such as finding the shortest path
                    to a location using Dijkstra's algorithm, or writing an entire program that allows building a catalog (e.g. of cars)
                    dynamically by user input and then storing the data locally. The OOP Project involved:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Various logic code to filter smaller subsets of data from collections in accordance to user preferences</li>
                    <li>Writing custom extensions of Java classes (such as custom comparables for sorting)</li>
                    <li>Serverside code to connect to a MongoDB database</li>
                    <li>Database queries in Java with the help of the Spring Boot library. An example of a query I've written is one that
                        uses regex to retrieve usernames matching a certain pattern</li>
                    <li>Utilizing the DAO design pattern for data access within the server code</li>
                    <li>Making the database accessible via a REST controller</li>
                    <li>Encrypted password storage in the database</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>Learned JavaScript in univesity as part of the  Web & Database Technology course. I have built a Chess web application powered by
                    Node.js (on the server) and JavaScript (on the client) in collaboration with another student. The project itself involved
                    writing the entire Chess logic from scratch both on the client and the server.
                    We have fully implemented the majority of chess rules, including movement, invalid move checking,
                    checkmating, converting Pawn after it reaches the other side of the board and movement of the board. Visually, we have written the entire html
                    from scratch and styled it with CSS, while also providing various functionality with clientside JavaScript (e.g. blinking tile in red when invalid move
                    is made). We kept some logic on the serverside, such as pairing players for matches, returning responses for certain actions (such as end of match,
                    move validity, etc.)</p>

                <h3>Other Experience</h3>
                <p>Although not relevant skills to the project, this experience heavily contributes to my understanding of the technologies
                    involved in App Inventor:

                <h2>Experience With Teams</h2>
                <h3>Java Online Social-network Like Application to track CO2 emissions</h3>
                <p>Ongoing university project as part of the Object Oriented Programming Project course.
                    The size of the team is 7 people. My role in the team is mainly working on the database part of the backend of the application,
                    as well as handling most of the technical parts of the project (setting up CI, deploying application to a remote host, etc.)
                    The project in general has been very successful, as we have successfully been able to distribute our workflow, discuss changes,
                    new features and plan our work. The project follows Agile development principles and the work is planned by Scrum planning.
                </p>

                <h3>Chess Web Application</h3>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/lightingft/cse404-chess">PixelChess</a></p>
                <p>Done as part of the Web & Database Technology course. I have worked in a collaboration with one other person
                    to build a fully functional Node.js web application. Since we were only 2 people, all of our work and discussions
                    were done in person. However, we have made use of GitHub for version control and an efficient workflow.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Finance Manager Android Application</h3>
                <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=emporium.financecalendar">FinBuddy (Google Play)</a></p>
                <p>I have worked together with 3 other people during the last year of my high school on an Android application. Although my
                    collaborators did not code (I was responsible for all the programming work), they have participated in suggesting ideas,
                    designing the application, suggesting various new features, changes and modifications of the code. Therefore, communication was
                    a crucial aspect of this project, and therefore I have been able to successfully satisfy each request and the end result
                    is a fully functioning Android application.
                </p>

                <h3>AppInventor Contributions</h3>
