                <h2>Interest in App Inventor</h2>
                <p>One of the main reasons why I’m interested in working with App Inventor is that I truly love the idea of accessible Android development
                     for everyone and would like to contribute to the project to make it even better. Moreover, the work involved covers my main areas of interest -
                     Software Engineering, Java & Android development.</p>

                <h2>Proposed Summer Project</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>My main interest in working for the App Inventor project revolves around the Component projects.
                    The projects that I am interested in (in order) are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#project-charts"><b>Visualisation Component - main project of interest</b></a></li>
                        <li><a href="#project-menu">Menu Options</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#project-listview">Improvements in ListView</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>I am well aware that the project that I would be working on could potentially change, regardless, I would like to provide a short summary on
                    how I would approach each project of interest. For my proposed project, which is Visualisation Components, I will be more thorough with the details in the
                    following section.</p>

                <h3 id="project-charts">Visualisation Component</h3>
                <h4>Plan</h4>
                <p>For this project, I propose to use the MPAndroidChart library, since it is well documented, provides a variety of useful features and extensive customization,
                    a lot of different chart types and is easy to use without the need for much setup.
                    In fact, I have used this library in one of my previous projects (see <a href="#team-finbuddy">FinBuddy</a>)
                    and would very much lean towards using it again.
                </p>

                <p>Since this is my main project of interest, I have included a <a href="#timelines">Timeline</a> section dedicated
                    for the project. Moreover, in a later sub-section, I have included <a href="#code-examples">mockups and code examples</a>
                    to demonstrate how I would approach the project. In terms of workflow, my plan for the project would be:
                </p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Install the MPAndroidChart dependency to the build</li>
                    <li>Create an abstract class ChartComponent which extends from AndroidViewComponent for charts
                        (since charts share a lot of common attributes, events and methods). Since all of the charts have their
                        own counterparts (such as LineDataSet for the DataSet of the LineChart), I will most likely go with making the
                        ChartComponent abstract class a generic class, so we can pass in the class type per chart.
                    </li>
                    <li>Model a UML diagram for the abstract ChartComponent, which will include all the base functionality (relevant attributes and methods).
                        For instance, every chart has a Legend, DataSet, XAxis, YAxis, Colors, ValueFormatter, AxisValueFormatter
                        and various style settings, therefore it's better to add these properties to the abstract base class itself.
                        Moreover, each Chart will have an addEntry method and methods for datasets, therefore there should be at least an abstract
                        definition of the methods in this base class.
                    </li>
                    <li>Model concrete Chart Classes in the UML diagram. There may be some additional properties and methods for concrete charts,
                        for instance showing slice labels as percentage rather than as values in Pie Charts.
                        Moreover, while modelling the concrete charts, additional intermediate abstract classes might be needed to reduce code redundancy,
                        since some charts (e.g. Line Chart & Bar Chart) are very similar, while others differ significantly in terms of entries (e.g. Candle Stick Chart)
                    </li>
                    <li>Moving on to the implementation, after the UML diagram is fully established, I can then proceed with
                        implementing the actual attributes and relevant functions (e.g. adding entry) with annotations for each chart, starting
                        with the abstract ChartComponent base class. This and the next step will of course follow the UML
                        diagram very closely.
                    </li>
                    <li>After ChartComponent is done, I will then proceed with concrete chart implementations. I plan
                        to implement every chart that is available in the MPAndroidChart library, and for each chart,
                        I will make a separate class that extends the abstract ChartComponent class. The components
                        will then be put under a new category "Charts". In the end, the following classes for
                        concrete implementations will be present: LineChart, BarChart, PieChart, ScatterChart,
                        BubbleChart, RadarChart, CandleStickChart. (each one is shown in a <a href="#chart-visual-demo">following section</a>).
                    </li>
                    <li>After we are done with the attributes, events are needed for added functionality to the
                        charts. Fortunately, MPAndroidChart provides various Gestures and an OnGestureListener which
                        works via callbacks and MotionEvents. The gestures include the typical Android view events (long-press,
                        tap, double-tap, touch up, touch down) plus a few extra ones related to the charts (zoom, drag).
                        In general, these apply to every chart and the functionality will go to ChartComponent.
                    </li>
                    <li>[OPTIONAL] Write unit tests for each Chart component (potentially making use of mocking libraries).
                        As this is part of another App Inventor project, I consider this optional, and this depends largely on the decisions
                        I would accept with my mentor(s). However, in any case, I will make sure to test the Chart Components as thoroughly as possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>Create an abstract class MockChartComponent that extends from MockVisibleComponent and add
                        the relevant logic to handle value changes in the Designer view.
                    </li>
                    <li>For each concrete chart class, create a class for the Mock Component that extends from MockChartComponent.
                        After this step and after loading the charts in SimpleComponentDescriptor,
                        we will be able to visually see the chart in the Designer view, as well as the changes that are applied
                        to the chart in Designer.
                    </li>
                    <li>Test each component in different browsers (just to be sure it works)</li>
                    <li>Write the corresponding documentation for each Chart component, possibly under a new page for the Charts category.</li>
                    <li>[BONUS] MPAndroidChart provides the ability to construct Custom Markers when clicked on an entry on a Chart.
                        This can be well put to use in this project to allow even more customization to the charts or have some sort
                        of standard for the markers. Therefore, I propose this as a bonus feature for the project.
                        See <a href="https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki/IMarker-Interface">link for reference</a>.

                <p>Firstly, to actually get the MPAndroidChart library to work, the .jar has to be added.
                    After downloading the MPAndroidChart library .jar, it is added to <i>"lib\mpandroidchart\"</i>

                <p><i>The relevant lines need to be added in buildserver/build.xml and components/build.xml for the library classes to be found
                    and compiled. See preview code link at the beginning of this subsection for more details.

                <p><i>The ChartComponent class is refactored from the previous subsection. The class itself is made abstract,
                    and a generic class that extends the MPAndroidChart abstract Chart generic (to indicate that T must
                    be of type Chart). The view is then made to be of type T and non-final & protected (since it will be instantiated in the implementation classes),
                    and a new protected method initChart() is added that will take care of initializing common functionality for Chart implementations.

                <p><i>The LineChart also has to be refactored a bit. It is made final, since no other classes will extend
                    from the LineChart. Moreover, the constructor is made public, so that it can be instantiated for applications.
                    The view is initialized to be the LineChart object that is
                    part of the added MPAndroidChart library. At the end of the constructor code, initChart() is called, which
                    is part of the abstract ChartComponent class. Here I have also included code to load test
                    data for demonstration purposes.

                <h3 id="project-menu">Menu Options</h3>
                <h4>Plan</h4>
                <p>General summary of the plan for the adding Menu Options project:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Create new component MenuOptions that extends the AndroidNonvisibleComponent class. This could then be put under
                        the UserInterface category.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create getters and setters for the property "Menu Elements" which would represent all user defined Menu Elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>Write additional code in the component itself to handle adding the Menu Elements into the
                        context menu and attaching listeners to them. Moreover, the two default options should still remain in the list
                        regardless of user settings (in my opinion), and right now I would aim towards keeping them at the
                        end of the list (after the User defined options)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the current two default options (About Application and Stop Application), I believe they should
                        be added after all the user-defined options have been added. Additionally, the Menu Options component could
                        have two additional Boolean properties to toggle the two menu options in the list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make all menu options use the same listener, but make the event return a certain value
                        (either Menu entry name or index) through dispatchEvent.
                    </li>
                    <li>Write an event for the listener, which would have one attribute - the value returned by the callback
                        (Menu entry name/index)</li>
                    <li>
                        Additional alterations to Form.java might be needed, since two menu options are added in that class. Possibly step 3 & 4
                        might need to be done in Form.java instead.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Thoroughly test the component.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Write documentation for the component.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>File Paths</h4>

                <h4>Plan</h4>
                <p>General summary of the plan for the making Improvements in ListView project:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify all required extensions and improvements to list view to get the general idea of the features to implement</li>
                    <li>Create a custom adapter for the list view that can be extended with the needed features (such as adding icons and pictures)</li>
                    <li>Right now I would consider perhaps having one list for images and one for text, so that each adapter entry would have both an Image and a String.
                        In the case where one of them is not present, it is simply not displayed (set to View.GONE)
                    </li>
                    <li>Add additional properties for the new features (e.g. Pictures list attribute for icons/pictures)</li>
                    <li>Write documentation for the new features</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>Properly scope and decide on the project with the mentor(s). One of the very important
                        parts of this point is to decide on how intricate should the charts be in general,
                        in terms of the properties, for instance, such that it would be highly user friendly
                        and not confuse new users.

                        to get an excellent head start to prepare for the actual coding period.
                    </li>
                    <li>Analyse relevant parts of the codebase deeper to get a better understanding

                    <li>Other minor changes (such as setup the Chart messages to work with translations)</li>
                    <li>[BONUS] Potentially work on the proposed Marker implementation</li>
                    <li>Deployment</li>
                    <li><b>Workload for mid Week 7 up to Week 12 to be discussed with mentor at beginning of project (so this project can be further well scoped).
                        In general, I am mainly interested in working further with components (the chart component, Menu Options, Improvement in ListView, or any others).
                        However, I would also be interested in any other work related to Blocks.

                <h3>Personal Commitments</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately, there will be two periods of time where I will be absent:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>June 28-July 2 - final exam period (partial absence)</li>
                    <li>July 8-15 or July 12-19 (one of these weeks) - pre-planned vacation (total absence)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    However, I believe this should not be a large
                    issue, since I will easily be able to compensate for the lost days. Generally, until July, I will be able to work
                    30-40 hours a week on the project (no more due to university). However, as soon as my final exams end, I would easily
                    be able to work 40-45 hours consistently on a weekly basis.

                <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=emporium.financecalendar">FinBuddy (Google Play)</a></p>
                <p>I have gained an extensive understanding of the Android SDK throughout developing Android applications for personal projects.
                    One of my major Android application releases is FinBuddy, which is a finance manager application
                    that is released on Google Play, and done in <a href="#team-finbuddy">collaboration with 3 other students</a>.
                    The application itself involved the following Android related programming work:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extending base Android view functionality, such as implementing a custom spinner with icons to adapt to the needs of the application</li>
                    <li>Implementing a custom side navigation menu, which has options that leads the User to the right screen or opens the required menu</li>
                    <li>Extending the functionality of the standard action bar by adding additional buttons and dynamically changing the title</li>
                    <li>Making use of a 3rd party Calendar library (Caldroid) to build the main interface of the calendar in the application.
                        This also involved writing additional code to extend the Calendar to the personal needs of the project.
                        The extra functionality, for instance, is displaying the amount of money spent/earned in one day on the Calendar cells.
                    </li>
                    <li>Implementing charts to display statistics about the user's expenses and savings. This has been done using the MPAndroidChart library.</li>
                    <li>Implementing other 3rd party libraries to achieve various functionality, such as advertisements and an image gallery.</li>
                    <li>Creation and utilizing of a SQLite database to store the user's data and being able to read and update it efficiently</li>
                    <li>Writing the logic for the application itself (events, goals, tasks, recurring events, total expense/income calculation, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Input validation of the text input fields (involved regexp, such as disallowing to input "." as a numeric value, or allowing to
                        input at most 2 numbers after the decimal point)
                    </li>
                    <li>Working with various Android events (mainly OnClickListeners for Buttons and OnValueChangeListeners for EditText)</li>
                    <li>Creating custom alert dialogs with icons for various scenarios (including alert dialogs which require user input)</li>
                    <li>Implementing in-app purchases using Google Play In-App Billing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Alongside this, I have also made an Android business simulation game application for a high school project together with two fellow students
                    (see <a href="#team-highschool">Experience with Teams</a> for more information and the report that we made)</p>

                <h3 id="dev-java">Java</h3>
                <p>Alongside Android Development, I have quite an extensive comprehension of Java due
                    to the large focus of the language in my University. So far, three courses involved extensive coding
                    in Java - Object-Oriented Programming, Algorithms & Data Structures, OOP Project. In the first two courses, I was
                    mainly writing small programs that involved solving a specific task, such as finding the shortest path
                    to a location using Dijkstra's algorithm, or writing a command line application that allows building a catalog of Objects
                    (e.g. of cars) dynamically by user input and then storing the data locally. The OOP Project involved:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Various logic code to filter smaller subsets of data from collections in accordance to user preferences.</li>
                    <li>Writing custom extensions of Java classes (such as custom comparables for sorting)</li>
                    <li>Server code to connect to a MongoDB database with the help of the Spring framework.</li>
                    <li>Database queries in Java with the help of the Spring Boot library. An example of a query I have written is one that
                        uses regex to retrieve usernames matching the text query specified by the user.</li>
                    <li>Utilizing the DAO design pattern for data access within the server code.</li>
                    <li>Making the database accessible via a REST controller.</li>
                    <li>Encrypted password storage in the database.</li>
                    <li>pom.xml maintenance, deploying server to remote location (Heroku), setting up GitLab CI to compile the project,
                        run the tests, force CheckStyle and 90% test coverage, and create artifacts for both CheckStyle & test results.
                    </li>
                    <li>Unit testing for server independent parts of the code.</li>
                    <li>Integration & Mock Tests for server functionality testing.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 id="dev-javadoc">JavaDoc</h3>
                <p>During my studies, we were always required to write JavaDoc for the OOP & OOP Project courses. As such, I have developed
                    a good habit of always writing JavaDoc for my Java code, despite whether I'm working alone on the project, or with
                    someone else. As such, I am familiar with the format of JavaDoc, some of the available annotations (@return, @param, @author, @exception)
                    as well as the general practices of JavaDoc.
                </p>

                <h3 id="dev-git">Git & GitHub</h3>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/lightingft">Personal GitHub</a></p>
                
                <p>Throughout my course work and several individual projects that I have worked on, I have chosen to and was obliged
                    to use Git. For the Web & Database Course, I was extensively using and learning Git as a newcomer for roughly 2 months,
                    and have been able to become quite familiar with it. I have then extended my knowledge by applying it
                    to personal projects (a few uploaded repositories, two personal websites, two example projects). Moreover, I have
                    been able to extend my knowledge even further with somewhat more advanced knowledge
                    (CI, feature branching, Git Flow branching strategy, branch protection, code reviewing, head detaching, commit rebasing, resetting, checkout)
                    through the OOP Project course, which is done in GitLab and is now ongoing for roughly 2 months. In addition,
                    the guidance of the community throughout my App Inventor contributions has also greatly assisted me in understanding
                    some more advanced concepts of Git (understanding checkout and rebase further)
                </p>

                <h3 id="dev-junit">JUnit</h3>
                <p>Due to coursework demands, I have been able to become strongly familiar with automated testing, and in general, JUnit.
                    Apart from general unit testing, "bad weather behaviour" testing practices and edge case testing, I have also managed to gain
                    a lot of knowledge in mock testing (using Mockito and PowerMock) and integration testing, specifically for RESTful applications (REST controllers, Requests,
                    database access related code). Moreover, as one of the course requirements, I have managed to set up GitLab CI that uses JaCoCo
                    to check for a certain test coverage (which uses JUnit tests), as well as display the test outcomes in Pull Requests.
                    This has also assisted me in familiarizing myself with the knowledge of the testing workflow.
                    Although I have been using JUnit consistently for around 6 months now for coursework, I believe I still have a lot to learn in terms
                    of testing.
                </p>

                <h3 id="dev-js">JavaScript</h3>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/lightingft/cse404-chess">PixelChess (GitHub)</a></p>
                <p><a href="https://cse404-chess.herokuapp.com/">PixelChess (Heroku)</a> (pairs players automatically upon clicking Play. Can be played by
                    one person by opening two browser windows)</p>
                <p>Learned JavaScript in university as part of the  Web & Database Technology course. I have built a Chess web application powered by
                    Node.js (on the server) and JavaScript (on the client) in <a href="#team-chess">collaboration with another student</a>. The project itself involved
                    writing the entire Chess logic from scratch both on the client and the server.
                    We have fully implemented the majority of chess rules, including movement, invalid move checking,
                    checkmating, converting a Pawn after it reaches the other side of the board and board rotation depending on the Player's piece colour. Visually,
                    we have written the entire HTML from scratch and styled it with CSS, while also providing various functionality with client-side JavaScript
                    (e.g. blinking tile in red when invalid move is made). We kept some logic on the server-side, such as pairing players for matches, returning
                    responses for certain actions (such as end of match, move validity, etc.). Outside of this project, I have also written small amounts
                    of JavaScript code to perform small tasks (e.g. highlight anchor links in this proposal page, initialize & load the navigation bar on my personal website)</p>
                
                <h3 id="dev-other">Other Experience</h3>
                <p>Although not relevant skills to the project, this experience heavily contributes to my understanding of the technologies
                    involved in App Inventor as well as the general understanding of programming:

                <h2>Experience with Teams</h2>
                <p><i>Note: Some of these projects were explained more in depth in the <a href="#development">Experience with Development Tools</a></i> section,
                    therefore the project ideas are only presented very briefly in this section.</p>

                <h3>OOP Project</h3>
                <p><b>Status:</b> Ongoing</p>
                <p><b>Team size:</b> 7 people</p>
                <p><b>Duration:</b> 2.5 months</p>

                <p>Ongoing university project in GitLab as part of the Object Oriented Programming Project course.
                    The project goal is to build a fully functional Java online social network application that allows users to track the amount of CO2 they have saved
                    which can be achieved by logging certain environmentally friendly activities. The work in the team is done by following Agile development principles
                    and planned by Scrum planning.
                </p>

                <p>My role in the team is mainly working on the database part of the backend
                    of the application, some parts of the application logic (such as filtering data on the front end) as well as handling most of the technical parts
                    of the project (setting up CI, deploying the application to a remote host, etc.) The project in general has been very successful,
                    as we have successfully been able to learn and adapt Agile development principles and as a result efficiently distribute our workflow,
                    discuss changes and new features, as well as plan our work appropriately. We have also effectively managed to sort out the problems we had
                    during the project. Moreover, we have effectively coordinated our efforts (partly thanks to CI) to achieve a well maintained, near-100% test covered,
                    Checkstyle error-free codebase.
                </p>

                <h3 id="team-chess">PixelChess</h3>
                <p><b>Status:</b> <a href="#dev-js">Released</a></p>
                <p><b>Team size:</b> 7 people</p>
                <p><b>Duration:</b> 5 weeks</p>

                <p>Done as part of the Web & Database Technology course. The project goal was to build a fully functional board game multiplayer
                    Node.js web application. For this project, I have worked in collaboration with one other person.
                    Since we were only 2 people, all of our work and discussions were done in person. However, we have made
                    use of GitHub for version control and an efficient workflow. In general, despite the major issues we had with Git as newcomers,
                    we have successfully been able to finish the project and learn how to use Git efficiently.

                <h3 id="team-finbuddy">FinBuddy</h3>
                <p><b>Status:</b> <a href="#dev-android">Released</a></p>
                <p><b>Team size:</b> 4 people</p>
                <p><b>Duration:</b> 7 months</p>
                <p>I have worked together with 3 other people during the last year of my high school on an Android application.
                    The goal was to create an application that allows the user to track their expenses and income, while also
                    providing various useful functionality that helps them do so - such as charts, recurring events, and goals.
                </p>
                
                <p>Although my collaborators did not code (I was responsible for all the programming work), they have participated in coming up with ideas,
                    designing the application, suggesting various new features and modifications to the application. Therefore, communication was
                    a crucial aspect of this project, and I have been able to successfully satisfy each request and work closely
                    with my teammates. The end result is a fully functioning Android application that is released on Google Play.
                </p>

                <h3 id="team-highschool">Business Guy</h3>
                <p><b>Status:</b> Finished & Documented</p>
                <p><b>Team size:</b> 3 people</p>
                <p><b>Duration:</b> 8 months</p>

                <p>I have worked together with 2 fellow students in building an Android application from scratch. The general intention was 
                    to learn Android application development and write a report on the work done.
                </p>

                <p>We were all beginners in Android and Java development then, and I took the role as the lead programmer. I was able to successfully
                    carry out requests and communicate on mutual changes with my group mates, and we have successfully managed to cooperate and
                    combine our work that we have done into one project. It was also generally a very good mutual learning experience, as we all
                    became acquainted with Android development, and for me, this was a really good head start into Android development.
                    Moreover, I have successfully been able to teach my teammates how to build Android layouts in XML.
                </p>

                <p>We have made an extensive documentation and presentation slides for the application. The presentation slides were
                    generally intended for a general audience with minimal knowledge of programming, while the report was intended for our mentoring
                    IT teacher. Unfortunately, it was all written in the Lithuanian language, but I think this gives a good impression of my
                    involvement in Android development at a young age (this was done roughly 2-3 years ago):
