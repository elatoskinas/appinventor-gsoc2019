                <h2>Interest in App Inventor</h2>
                <p>One of the main reasons why I’m interested in working with App Inventor is that I truly love the idea of accessible Android development
                     for everyone and would like to contribute to the project to make it even better. Moreover, this project covers my main areas of interest
                     (Software Engineering, Java & Android development).</p>

                <h2>Interest In Introductory Programming</h2>
                <p>Being a freshman, I have not had the opportunity to get involved in teaching as actively yet. However, throughout my first year of university,
                    I have actively helped my fellow peers learn and understand concepts & topics better by explaining it in depth and providing my own examples,
                    as well as helping them with any issues that they have encountered in their code projects, assignments or while self-studying. I have helped with the following courses:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>OOP Project (Java Application)</li>
                        <li>Object-Oriented Programming (in Java)</li>
                        <li>Algorithms & Data Structures (algorithmic problems in Java)</li>
                        <li>Web & Database Technology (JavaScript)</li>
                        <li>Computer Organization (Assembly)</li>

                <h3>Java Online Social-network Like Application to track CO2 emissions</h3>
                <p>Ongoing university project as part of the Object Oriented Programming Project course.
                    The size of the team is 7 people. My role in the team is mainly working on the database part of the backend of the application,
                    as well as handling most of the technical parts of the project (setting up CI, deploying application to a remote host, etc.)
                    The project in general has been very successful, as we have successfully been able to distribute our workflow, discuss changes,
                    new features and plan our work. The project follows Agile development principles and the work is planned by Scrum planning.

                <p><a href="https://github.com/lightingft/cse404-chess">PixelChess</a></p>
                <p>Done as part of the Web & Database Technology course. I have worked in a collaboration with one other person
                    to build a fully functional Node.js web application. Since we were only 2 people, all of our work and discussions
                    were done in person. However, we have made use of GitHub for version control and an efficient workflow.

                <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=emporium.financecalendar">FinBuddy (Google Play)</a></p>
                <p>I have worked together with 3 other people during the last year of my high school on an Android application. Although my
                    collaborators did not code (I was responsible for all the programming work), they have participated in suggesting ideas,
                    designing the application, suggesting various new features, changes and modifications of the code. Therefore, communication was
                    a crucial aspect of this project, and therefore I have been able to successfully satisfy each request and the end result
                    is a fully functioning Android application.
